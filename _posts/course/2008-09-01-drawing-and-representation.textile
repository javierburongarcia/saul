In third year we are introducing digital tools in your toolset. The main goal this year is to learn their strengths and weaknesses.Therefore, you will be able to wisely decide when and how to use them. At the same time, we will analyze how drawing and representation affect in the design process and we will learn principles and techniques to improve our representation skills.

Lastly, this course is also a way to enrich our general visual culture; not only in architecture but in graphic design, art and visual narrative.
