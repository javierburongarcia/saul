This lesson describe the three most common groups of color models in computer graphics: RGB and CMYK based on the physiology of human vision, HSV and HSL which try to simplify the use by defining abstract attributes more recognizable by human vision, and the standardized method used in Pantone and RAL color systems.

Each group has certain strengths and weaknesses, understanding them would help us to work with color in computers graphics. A real world example about how to use HSV color pickers for rendering volumes is also included.
