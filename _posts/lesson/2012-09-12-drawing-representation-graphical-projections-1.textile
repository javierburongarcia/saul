The desire of capturing tridimensional objects into flat surfaces is as old as human history. In this first part of the lesson we discover the origin of graphical projections and the different techniques that humans have developed through centuries by using increasingly complex mathematical and geometric methods.

An sketchup file is shared as part of the reference material explaining how parallel, isometric and perspective projections work.
