The rapid development on geometry and mathematics during the Renaissance fostered creative uses of perspective on the forthcoming centuries. New discoveries on non-planar geometry on the nineteenth century century paved the ground for a highly experimental development on graphical projections which were able to represent abstract concepts like infinite spaces, recursive loops, fractals and non-euclidean geometries.

An sketchup file is shared as part of the reference material explaining the basic construction of a camera and how focal length affects the perspective construction of a projected image.
