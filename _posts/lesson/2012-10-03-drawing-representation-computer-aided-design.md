Computer graphics' history is not older than 4 decades but it has profoundly change visual representation and has been instrumental in the adoption of computers by the general public. This lesson gives a general introduction on the history of computer graphics  –Charles Csuri, Ivan Sutherland & Sketchpad…– and in particular those events, innovations and characters related with the use of computers as design tools.

The last part of the lesson focuses on Architecture and shocases 4 different architectural practices by the way they use computers on their design process.
