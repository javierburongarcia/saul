There are hundreds of different Computer Aided Design solutions available, from complex and expensive corporate solutions to open source alternatives. In this lesson, we discuss common features presented in every CAD software and point out which things we need to consider when choosing the best CAD software for our needs.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an object-oriented approach to Computer Aided Design which is generating an increasingly interest in the last decade. We debate its potential and current limitations in student design studio environments.
