During the last years of the 20th century mainstream architecture and design progressively lost interest in socially concern issues that decades ago were central in every architecture debate. Recently a new generation of designers have reclaimed an active role in today's society new challenges with innovative ideas and approaches.

This was an introductory talk for 3rd year architecture Design Studio featuring some of these projects. The talk was structured in four different approaches or themes: 

**Reuse not recycle** presents four non-hightech projects about energy efficiency; **New social models** showcases four initiatives that question traditional social interaction models; **Understanding popular media** describes two projects intimately related to mass media perception on public issues; & **Self-made architecture** features two built projects in which users interaction goes beyond the expected.
